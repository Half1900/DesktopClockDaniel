A digital clock app for your Windows desktop that remains visible on screen for whenever you need it. With a right-click, you can access a menu offering essential options like size, time zone, format, and theme. You can even make new clocks from the same menu. For power users, "advanced settings" provides even more configuration choices in a familiar JSON format. There is also a countdown mode, allowing you to set a countdown to any date of your choice.
