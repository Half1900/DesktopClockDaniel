A digital clock app for your Windows desktop that remains visible on screen so it's there whenever you need it.  
With a right-click, you can access a menu that offers essential options like size, time zone, format, and theme. You can make new clocks from the same menu. Double left-clicking will copy the time to the clipboard, and holding Ctrl while scrolling will resize the clock. For power users, "advanced settings" provides even more configuration choices in a familiar JSON format. Additionally, the app features a countdown mode that allows you to set a countdown to any date of your choice.
